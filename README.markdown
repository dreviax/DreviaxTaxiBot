## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Core bot logic, including menu handling, payment processing, and startup.
- `settings/`
  - `config.py`: Configuration for bot token, channel ID, and menu text.
  - `database.py`: SQLite database management for user and order data.
  - `keyboard.py`: Inline keyboard definitions for navigation and payments.

## Usage

1. **Start the Bot**:
   - Use the `/start` command in a private chat to access the main menu.
   - The bot posts the main menu to the configured channel on startup.

2. **Main Menu**:
   - ðŸ›’ **Buy Orders**: Purchase 1, 5, or 10 orders using Telegram Stars.
   - ðŸ“¦ **Order Taxi**: Submit a message link to place a taxi order (requires available orders).
   - ðŸ‘¤ **Profile**: View your user ID and available orders.

3. **Payment Flow**:
   - Select an order package (1, 5, or 10 orders).
   - Pay using Telegram Stars.
   - On successful payment, the invoice message is deleted, and a confirmation is sent with the main menu.
   - Cancel payments to delete the invoice and return to the main menu.

## Database Schema

The bot uses an SQLite database (`orders.db`) with the following schema:

- **users** table:
  - `user_id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY): Telegram user ID.
  - `num_order` (INTEGER, DEFAULT 0): Number of available orders.

## Notes

- Ensure the bot has appropriate permissions in the Telegram channel for posting and deleting messages.
- Test payments in a private chat, as Telegram Stars payments are processed in private chats.
- MarkdownV2 formatting is used for messages; ensure special characters are escaped correctly to avoid parsing errors.
- Errors (e.g., failed message deletions) are logged to the console for debugging.
